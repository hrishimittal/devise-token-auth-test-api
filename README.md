# Test Rails 6 app for devise_token_auth gem

This is a test app to verify the fix for a bug in the [devise_token_auth](https://github.com/lynndylanhurley/devise_token_auth/) gem which causes the install generator to fail.

The fix is on this forked branch - [https://github.com/hrishimittal/devise_token_auth/tree/fix-for-rails6](https://github.com/hrishimittal/devise_token_auth/tree/fix-for-rails6)

This app uses Ruby 2.7.1 and Rails 6.0.3.1 (the latest release at the time of creating this app).
